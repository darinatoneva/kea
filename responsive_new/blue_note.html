			<h3 class="second_font" id="link2">What is a blue note?</h3>
			<p>In jazz and blues, a blue note is a note that
				for expressive purposes is sung or played at a
				slightly different pitch than standard. Typically
				the alteration is between a quartertone and a
				semitone, but this varies among performers and
				genres.</p>

			<a href="Resources/Images/blue_note_records.png" target="_blank"><img class="blue_note" src="Resources/Images/blue_note_records_small.png" alt="Blue Note Records"></a>
			<p>This is an American jazz record label that is owned by Universal Music Group and operated with Decca Records. Established in 1939 by Alfred Lion and Max Margulis, it derives its name from the blue notes of jazz and the blues. Originally dedicated to recording traditional jazz and small group swing, from 1947 the label began to switch its attention to modern jazz. Although the original company did not record many of the pioneers of bebop, significant exceptions are Thelonious Monk, Fats Navarro and Bud Powell. Historically, Blue Note has principally been associated with the “hard bop” style of jazz (mixing bebop with other forms of music including soul, blues, rhythm and blues and gospel), but also recorded essential albums in the avant-garde and free styles of jazz. Horace Silver, Jimmy Smith, Freddie Hubbard, Lee Morgan, Art Blakey, Grant Green, Hank Mobley, Wayne Shorter, Bobby Hutcherson, and Jackie McLean were among the label’s leading artists. During its heyday, the 1950s and 1960s, the photography and graphic art of Reid Miles created a series of iconic album covers, often incorporating session photos by Wolff, which added to Blue Note’s artistic reputation.</p>

			<p>Reid Miles (4 July 1927 – 2 February 1993) was an American modernist designer, a genius of his time, best known for his work for Blue Note Records through the 1950’s and 60’s. During this period he designed almost 500 record covers for the label. In the Fifties, Miles often worked in close collaboration with Andy Warhol, who helped him turn his concept designs to illustrations. One of the most famous results of this joint effort between the two is the cover of The Congregation by Johnny Griffin, which has reached an iconic status in the history of jazz.</p>

			<h3 class="second_font" id="link5">What does modern jazz look like?</h3>
			<p>For a lot of music fans, the visual identity of jazz has become synonymous with a single record label that defined the sound and feeling of the musical style during its transformation from the complicated melodies of bebop to the soulful hooks of hard bop during the 1950s and ’60s. That record label is Blue Note, and their album covers are so iconic, they’ve been the point of inspiration for graphic designers and musicians for the past 60 years.</p>

			<p>Freddie Hubbard’s Hub Cap is a quintessential example of the main ingredients of the style: bold colors, candid photography, and perfectly placed typography. I think typography in the early Fifties was in a renaissance period anyway. It happened especially on album covers because they were not so restrictive as advertising.” – Reid Miles</p>
