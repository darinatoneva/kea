				<h1>Hello!</h1>
				<p>

					My name is Darina and I am a first semester student in Multimedia Design and Communication at KEA - Copenhagen School of Design and Technology. This is my portfolio website containing individual and group projects as part of our first semester training.
				</p>
				<h1>What I learned</h1>
				<p>
					There are many things I learned, and I will probably miss something, but I will try to briefly mention the more important topics we went through the semester.
					<br><br>
					During the first part of the semester, called "Basic Web" I learned about Design Principles, Basic colour theory and colour schemes and typography. We learned how to start designing something from scratch using moodboard, style tiles, sketching, wireframing and prototyping and how important it is, to not skip any one of these different stages. We sketched and later on we created our own vector graphics, icons and logotype in Adobe Illustrator.
					<br><br>I already have basic knowledge of video capture and video editing, sound handling, animation creation and much more.
					<br><br>
					I learned how to produce semantic markup, develop cascading style sheets and to build responsive websites through HTML5 and CSS3. Last but not least, I learned how to build high fidelity prototypes via Adobe XD and how to use them for testing the usability of our designs. We were introduced to some of the UX usability tests, how to conduct them and how to use them for further improvements of our designs.
