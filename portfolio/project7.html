			<h1>XD Prototype "I Bike Cph"</h1>
			<br><br>

			<p>
				Before we started our work on the prototype and design of the site, we had already defined our target group (young adults) and on that basis we decided that our site should be in bright and cheerful colors/from the design guide/, to be very minimalistic and contain only the most important information.
				<br><br>After making the first prototype, we conducted tests in class and found that young people do not like to read explanatory texts and prefer the information to be brief and accurate. All of the people with whom we conducted tests also confirmed the fact that videos are preferred instead of reading text.
				<br><br>The conclusions we made following the tests made us change the content of the website by leaving only the rules, clearly legible and in red, to attract attention. And the main focus of our website is actually the video.
				<br><br>The improvements that I personally plan to do for a future on this project and which unfortunately I had not been able to do now are:
				<br>1. To add a little text to the gallery page, as we were advised by the lecturers;
				<br>2. To work on the mobile version of the site and on the code improvement;
				<br>3. I think it would be good to add one page with more information about hiring a bicycle in Copenhagen and companies which provide such bicycles, general rules, emergency phones and other useful information. My idea is when someone opens the website, to find everything related to cycling in Copenhagen.
