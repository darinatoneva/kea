				<p>
					The assignment was to build a responsive website of a given style (Blue Note in my case), including information and images related to the style as well as showing the overall process of creating the website, like creating style tile, moodboard, color scheme, typography and so.on. There was a requirement to use responsive principles of front end web design like media queries, grid design and flexible content to build our website.

				<p>
					In this second theme of semester 1 called Basic Animation we learned about character design and storytelling. So in this individual assignment I had to tell a story by my choice having in mind concepts of basic animation, classic storytelling and character design. I chose to tell a story (about a small potato called Poto), that we used to have fun with in my family. It's called "Poto and the mission of his life".

					In this project I had the pleasure to be a part of a group called "Monty Python" with Charlotte, Ester and Timi. We had to create a digital, interactive poster for one of ten possible movies. The sender was Cinemateket - the most prominent part of the Danish Film Institute’s public film house.

					In this last theme of the first semester called "Basic UX" our main focus was on "Design sprint" and how to use it for planning, designing, prototyping and testing of a new digital product, like an app in our case. We had to make a prototype of a new "Fronter" ( our teaching platform, which consist all the nessessary information for students and teachers ) with a focus on the mobile-first design.
