				<h1>Hello!</h1>
				<p>

					My name is Darina Toneva and I am from Bulgaria. I have been living in Denmark since the summer of 2017. By education I am a Bachelor of Economic Management, but shortly after graduation I decided to devote myself to Graphic Design and I worked as a Graphic Designer for more than ten years. I worked in advertising agencies in Bulgaria, where I had the opportunity to create designs primarily designed for printing on different media and through different technologies. Currently I am a student in Multimedia Design and Communication at KEA - Copenhagen School of Design and Technology.
					<br>Why this specialty?
					<br>Because it is very closely related to Graphic Design; <br>Because "the whole world" is already digital and is working increasingly in this direction;
					<br>Because it is a great challenge to design something that should be dynamic, to work well and to make people's live easier or just to make them happy.
